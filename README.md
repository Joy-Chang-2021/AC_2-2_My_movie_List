## My movie list
This is one of my frontend practice project in ALPHAcamp.

## Learning point
- get content from API: produce the movie list
- search Bar: search movies by title
- using localStorage: add movies to my favorite list, or remove movies from my favorite list
- pagination: arrange a specific number of movies on each page, and use paginator to get to the specific page
- display mode: change to the specific display mode in any condition
